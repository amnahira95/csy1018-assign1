            <h3>Activities (Hobbies and Interests)</h3>

            <p>One of my favourite hobbies is doing photography. Yes I can say, I am a part time photographer. I like attending events and do photoshoots. I relate this hobby to my study field because I have really good Photoshop skills, photography is definitely
                improving my image optimising skills. Another thing I prefer doing in my spare time is to play around with different programming languages, this summer I made a calculator using Java which I think is going to help me in the next term when
                we will be actually making interfaces and software using Java. Web development is also my favourite whenever I get some time I improve my skills using Code Academy, learning new things is definitely my favourite hobby. And I also read
                books from different Authors, one of my favorites is “Khaled Hosseini”.</p>
