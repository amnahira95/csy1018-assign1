## Work description and development

While making my Digital Portfolio I had to go through a lot of stages and decisions in order to come up with an idea on how to design my website. I first visited different portfolios. Here are some links for them: http://www.megangtalley.com/connect.html, http://www.andyhau.com/, http://mikekus.com/.

The only portfolio that I liked the most was the "Megan Talley" one. Below you can see an image of the Megan portfolio and a description of what attracted me the most.

This is a screenshot of the homepage. What attracted me was the layout and the menu of it, it is very simple and makes the content clearly visible. Where you can see the title, I inserted my Logo there and then the Menu is below that. However I used a different color scheme,  

## Color-scheme ##

To select the correct color scheme for my website, I checked a lot of sites which provided me RGB colors and the one that I found easy was "http://colllor.com/3597e3" I selected a blue color which provided me all the different shades I could use in designing my site. Below you can see what Colors shades I used for the layout.

For the menu I used a shade of red color, I wanted the menu to look different. I added the hover effect as well. When the user would hover the mouse over the shade will turn lighter.

## My Logo ##

I made my Logo using Photoshop software working through different Layers, and I kept the background transparent so when I was going to save it in PNG format, the white background was not visible. The color scheme was black and blue, I kept it blue so it would match the color of my website. My logo has my Name initials on it "Mahmood Amna Hira" Below you can see my Logo with "MAH" written on it.

## Google Fonts ##

I wanted my website font to be stylish so I used two google fonts. I had to select a couple first to come up with the right decision at the end. I tried 3-4 fonts and at the end I only liked "Sofia" and "Trocchi", so I used Sofia for all the headings and for the body font I used Trocchi font. Also the font size changes when the website is turned to mobile version, I added this feature because if the screen is smaller the text should be also smaller.

## Sketches

## Mockups/Wireframes

#### Homepage (index.html) ####

![Homepage](images/index-wireframe.jpg)

This is the wireframe I made for the Homepage, it is very simple. Where it says "image" there I will be placing my own image, and below heading I will write a short description about me. I will also add icons on the footer of my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter where people can follow me to know more about me. And the logo will be situated at the top in the middle of the screen, below the Logo I will be typing my name "Amna Hira Mahmood".
I will be adding a flex box of two columns in the middle of the screen where there is image and text so it will make it easier for me to add a media query later to make my website responsive.

#### Homepage (mobile version) ####

![Homepage](images/index-mv.png)

In this mobile version of my homepage as you can see the screen is less wide now and the height of the page is gone longer, this is because the user with this design can open the site on a mobile as well and scroll down the page to view the content easily. I will be performing this through adding a media query and by making the flex-box from "row" to one "column". Everything else will stay the same just the layout will be changing.

#### Biography page (bio.html) ####

![Biography](images/bio-wireframe.jpg)

In the biography page I will be adding the information about me, and I will also add 4 images on the left. The layout of the site will stay pretty much the same as the homepage. The content that doesn't change is the menu, header, and footer. They don't change in any page of the website. In the biography text I will be adding links to the contact page, just to make it more interactive with the user because reading long text can be boring this is why I will try to keep my biography short.

#### Biography page (mobile version) ####

![Biography](images/bio-mv.jpg)

I added a flexbox and media query in this the page as well to make it suitable for the mobile version, the layout will be just like the first page.


#### CV page (cv.html) ####

## Extra Features

Below I will list all the extra features I have included in my website:
- **ANIMATION** : I added animation to the header "biography" on bio page and "Welcome to my Digital portfolio" on index page. When the website opens the Title animates, it slides left to right continuously in slow motion.
- **FAVICON** I added a favicon to my website on each page. So when the website is opened on a browser the icon is visible at the top of the window rather than having it blank. This makes my website look more professional.
- **RAINBOW EFFECT TO HEADER** I added animation of rainbow effect to the title in the header where it says "Amna Hira Mahmood". The colors of the title keep changing to rainbow colors on every page with slow motion.
